The problem is that boost changed the name of the TIME_UTC constant in
version 1.50.  This issue was fixed in svn commit 9111, you can view the
changes with the sourceforge commit browser[1].

To work around this problem until the next Player release comes out, you
can just substitute "boost::TIME_UTC_" for "boost::TIME_UTC" in
client_libs/libplayerc++/playerclient.cc

Summary: Readlog incompatible with zlib 1.2.6

Initial Comment:

/home/stefano/builds/player/src/player-3.0.2/server/drivers/shell/readlog.cc:
In member function ‘virtual void ReadLog::Main()’:
/home/stefano/builds/player/src/player-3.0.2/server/drivers/shell/readlog.cc:668:43:
error: cannot convert ‘FILE* {aka _IO_FILE*}’ to ‘gzFile’ for argument
‘1’ to ‘off_t gzseek(gzFile, off_t, int)’
/home/stefano/builds/player/src/player-3.0.2/server/drivers/shell/readlog.cc:714:62:
error: cannot convert ‘FILE* {aka _IO_FILE*}’ to ‘gzFile’ for argument
‘1’ to ‘char* gzgets(gzFile, char*, int)’
make[2]: *** [server/libplayerdrivers/CMakeFiles/playerdrivers.dir/__/drivers/shell/readlog.o]
Error 1
make[1]: *** [server/libplayerdrivers/CMakeFiles/playerdrivers.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

This may be related to the API change in zlib from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6,
which is now installed on my system. According to another archlinux
user, there has been a change in zlib.h in 1.2.6:

-   typedef voidp gzFile;       /* opaque gzip file descriptor */
+ typedef struct gzFile_s *gzFile;    /* semi-opaque gzip file descriptor */ 


Fix:
668c668
<         ret = gzseek(this->file,0,SEEK_SET);
---
>         ret = gzseek((gzFile)this->file,0,SEEK_SET);
714c714
<         ret = (gzgets(this->file, this->line, this->line_size) == NULL);
---
>         ret = (gzgets((gzFile)this->file, this->line, this->line_size) == NULL);

For each error : undefined reference to symbol
'_ZN5boost6system15system_categoryEv' 
add the flag "-lboost_system" after "-lboost_signals" in the file
player-3.0.2/build/examples/libplayerc++/Makefile/*.dir/link.txt
For example :
player-3.0.2/build/examples/libplayerc++/Makefile/camera.dir/link.txt will
be : 
/usr/bin/c++    -Wall    CMakeFiles/camera.dir/camera.o  -o camera -rdynamic
